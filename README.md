# 911-Calls

### Description
This data science capstone project is meant to demonstrate my skills in using Python data manipulation/analysis 
and visualization libraries. These include NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

The data we will be using are [Emergency 911 Calls](https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/montcoalert) from Montgomery, PA.
